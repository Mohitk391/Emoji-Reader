# Emoji-Reader
Hello guys,  
Thank you for checking this out.  
This project is basically an emoji interpreter, where you can search for the meaning of an emoji you don't understand.  
You can copy/paste the emoji you have seen from somewhere else or you can check the emojis available here.  
Feel free to check it out. The link is provided in the link section. Any tips or feedback you can provide, will be super beneficial for me.  
Thank you, have a nice day!!
